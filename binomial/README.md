Overview
========

'"binomial"' is a minimal package which provides functions related to binomial distribution.

Motivation
==========

The package has been made to explore how the R packages are made.

Usage
=====

Choose Function
---------------

Use the function 'bin\_choose()' to get the calculated value trials choose success

Binomial Probability Function
-----------------------------

Use the function 'bin\_probability()' to calculate the binomial\_probability

Binomial Distribution Function
------------------------------

Use the function 'bin\_distribution()' to display the dataframe given the number of trials and the probability of success. The dataframe contains two columns: success, probability

You can create a barplot(successes vs. probability) using a dataframe created by the function 'bin\_distribution()'

Binomial Cumulative Function
----------------------------

Use the function 'bin\_cumulative()' to display the dataframe given the number of trials and the probability of success. The dataframe contains three columns: success, probability, cumulative

You can create a lineplot with dots (successes vs. cumulative probability) using a dataframe created by the created by the function 'bin\_cumulative()'.

Binomial Variable Function
--------------------------

The function 'bin\_variable()' will print two parameters: number of trials, prob of success

When you use the summary function for the contents created from 'bin\_variable()', it prints seven elements:

-   trials: number of trials
-   prob: probability of success
-   mean: mean or expected value
-   variance: variance
-   mode: mode
-   skewness: skewness
-   kurtosis: kurtosis

Functions of measures
---------------------

### Mean

The function 'bin\_mean()' calculates the mean given by the number of trials and the probability of success.

### Variance

The function 'bin\_variance()' calculates the variance given by the number of trials and the probability of success.

### Mode

The function 'bin\_mode()' calculates the mode given by the number of trials and the probability of success.

### Skewness

The function 'bin\_skewness()' calculates the skewness given by the number of trials and the probability of success.

### Kurtosis

The function 'bin\_kurtosis()' calculates the kurtosis given by the number of trials and the probability of success.
