##**Baked Buffalo Wings**#
![image of baked buffalo wings](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/oven-baked-buffalo-wings.jpg?w=1500)

* **Ingredients**
    + 1 tp 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes
    + 1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound)
    + 1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound; use less salt if you're not using Diamond brand)
    + 2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank's RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings
    + 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings
    + To serve (optional): Homemade Blue Cheese Dressing (below), plus celery and carrot sticks
    

* **"Special" Kitchen Tools**
    + one or more large sheet trays
    + backing sheet
    + foil
    + oven-safe cooling rack
    + paper towel
    
##### Steps of the Recipe

1. Line a large baking sheet with foil and set an oven-safe cooling rack on top.
2. Pat wings dry with a paper towel, and then, in a large bowl, toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking opwder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt *per pound of wings*, until thoroughly coated.
3. Arrange them on the rack with some space between them (the surface will not dry and crisp as well where they touch) and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.
4. When you're ready to bake them, heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven.
5. Bake your wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes.
6. Wings are donw with they are browned and crisp.
7. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine.
8. When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce.
9. Serve with fixings of your choice.
10. Eat immediately.

##### Special Season of the Year

There is no special season of the year for baked buffalo wings.

##### Variation of the recipe

* Cooking time will vary by the size of wingettes.
* You can make blue chesse dressing for sauce.

# Euclidean Distance

### Definition
***
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$). In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p~1~*, *p~2~*,..., *p~n~*) and **q** = (*q~1~*, *q~2~*,..., *q~n~*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$\begin{align}
d(\textbf{p}, \textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q}, \textbf{p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n - p_n)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i - p_i)^2}.
\end{align}$$
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. the **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\:\:\:\:\:\: \|\textbf{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \ \cdot \textbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
